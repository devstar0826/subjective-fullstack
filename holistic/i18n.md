# I18n and L10n

Unless you have to deal with 10+ different languages don't use any I18n library.
They'll bring you more pain than gain. There are many good of them.
jQuery [Globalize](https://github.com/jquery/globalize) has very good support.
Don't use it, though. Here is why.

1\. They're never flexible enough. All of them will have something like `long`, `middle` and `short` date formats
and be sure the format you'll need won't be there. There are *tons* of date-time representation in most cultures.
To account every of them you'll need Wikipidea, not a usable library. As soon as you start to implement
missing pieces – you'll have the layout, the code, and the opportunity to ditch the original library completely.

Even if one seems have what you need – it probably wraps *the wrong* library.
It wraps [MomentJS](http://momentjs.com/) while you'd love to use [Date-Fns](date-fns.org).
So you either sacrifice you preferences or bundle both...

2\. They are too heavy. Even when you disable all the "cultures" you don't need, the machinery is there.
I never met a popular I18n library (in any ecosystem) (and I've seen many) that wouldn't be bloated as hell.
I always felt like I was using only 1% to 10% of what they provided and paid for the 100%.
Your bundle will probably increase significantly with any I18n solution.

3\. You don't need them. There are specific libraries for any aspect I18n solutions so like to absorb.
Date formatting – use date library. Money formatting – use financial library.
Take my word – your I18n library will have either formatting or parsing either absent or broken.
Because *it's not the purpose*...

My rule of thumb is to never use a wrapper layer unless it adds something significant.
Most I18n wrappers hide functionality, do not expose libraries they wrap properly (or at all).

Don't need something sophisticated? Write a few oneliners on your own – it won't hurt.

4\. The truth is – you can't draw a line between I18n and non-I18n stuff. Gradually – your whole
app will leak under control of I18n provider. Because *everything* is cultural.
You will bundle with a special I18n-Webpack fork, you will run scripts with a special I18n-Node,
you will use a special I18n-Calculus to add some freaking numbers because of culture-specific
rounding rules.

Some tips for companies which don't have unlimited budgets for I18 "problems" and "experts":

* Use numbers instead of words.
* Use icons instead of words.
* Enforce `xxxx-xx-xx` date format and other universally understandable stuff.
* Keep courage to ignore "purists". Such people will complain anyway.
* Keep translations in database.
* Check how [Alibaba](https://www.alibaba.com/) works. It seems that people can not only
  communicate but even run successfull businesses having A0 or lower English.
