# Subjective Fullstack (book drafts)

We all know how useful and important is to view other other peoples doing their job.
Not to copy-paste (nothing wrong with that) but to reconsider your own choices, habits.
Especially – if youre working alone. Or if you're newcomer. Or if you're learning something new.

There are a lot of things people don't like talking about because they are "subjective".
A lot of such things turns out to be more important for your productivity and
quality you produce than those... "objective" ones.

The usual answer (if present) is "it depends" or "do how you prefer".
As if you have infinite time to try every library, framework, solution.
As if this process is more important then learning fundamental stuff like math.

In this text I will explore the most "secret" subjects, compare alternative solutions (if there are)
and give you some guides to reasonably choose between them (instead of "trying them all").
